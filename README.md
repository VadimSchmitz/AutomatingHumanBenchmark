### Goal
The goal of these small scripts is to further improve my coding ability and understand how the browser works with events. 
Another important thing to is that i want it to be all js based so it can run straight inside of the browser. However due to some security limitations inside the browser this is not always possible. Once this is applicatable it will be mentioned why a solution is diffrent from the goal.

One thing that should be noted is that there are many ways to automate these games, however using the events is in my opinion the most elegant and impressive way to do this.

Within the folders there are instructions of how the game works and how to use the script.
